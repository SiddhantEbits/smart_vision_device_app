# UI Terminology Update: YOLO → AI Model

## ✅ **UI TERMINOLOGY UPDATED!**

### 🔄 **Changes Made:**

All user-facing messages that previously used "YOLO model" have been updated to use "AI model" for better user experience and technical clarity.

### 📱 **Updated UI Messages:**

#### **1. MonitoringController:**
- ✅ **Before**: "YOLO model not loaded, attempting to load..."
- ✅ **After**: "AI model not loaded, attempting to load..."

- ✅ **Before**: "YOLO model failed to load"
- ✅ **After**: "AI model failed to load"

- ✅ **Before**: "YOLO model not loaded. Please restart the app."
- ✅ **After**: "AI model not loaded. Please restart the app."

- ✅ **Before**: "YOLO model loaded successfully"
- ✅ **After**: "AI model loaded successfully"

#### **2. DetectionTestingScreen:**
- ✅ **Before**: "🔄 Loading YOLO model..."
- ✅ **After**: "🔄 Loading AI model..."

- ✅ **Before**: "❌ YOLO model failed to load. Please restart the app."
- ✅ **After**: "❌ AI model failed to load. Please restart the app."

- ✅ **Before**: "✅ YOLO model loaded successfully"
- ✅ **After**: "✅ AI model loaded successfully"

#### **3. CameraStreamScreen:**
- ✅ **Before**: "YOLO Model Ready"
- ✅ **After**: "AI Model Ready"

- ✅ **Before**: "Loading YOLO Model..."
- ✅ **After**: "Loading AI Model..."

### 🚀 **Benefits:**

✅ **User-Friendly**: "AI model" is more understandable to non-technical users  
✅ **Professional**: More appropriate terminology for production applications  
✅ **Consistent**: All UI messages now use consistent terminology  
✅ **Clear**: Users understand they're waiting for AI detection capabilities  

### 🔍 **Technical Notes:**

- **Internal Code**: Debug logs and internal messages still use "YOLO" for technical clarity
- **UI Only**: Only user-facing messages have been changed
- **Functionality**: No functional changes, only terminology updates
- **Logging**: Debug logs maintain "YOLO" references for developer debugging

### 📱 **Build Status: ✅ SUCCESS**
```
✓ Built build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk
```

### 📱 **User Experience:**

Users will now see:
- "Loading AI Model..." instead of "Loading YOLO Model..."
- "AI Model Ready" instead of "YOLO Model Ready"
- "AI model not loaded" instead of "YOLO model not loaded"

This provides a more professional and user-friendly experience while maintaining all technical functionality.

**The UI terminology has been successfully updated throughout the application!** 🎯
